# Word Ladder

A Word Game where every next word must begin with the last letter of previous one. The game has several features that make gameplay more diverse: the next word cannot be shorter than previous one, it cannot contain banned letters randomly chosen by game, and you have a time limitation. 

At the present time I've released a demo-version of the game with complete singleplayer mode and an ability to play with friends. 

For the game to be completed, it must undergo a lot of stages of development. The first global target is perfected game itself released in Steam.
